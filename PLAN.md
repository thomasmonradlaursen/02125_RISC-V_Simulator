- Setup an Overleaf project
- Setup a Git repository
- Study the concepts of RISC-V 

## Week 2
- Rewrite ISA simulator for RV32I in Rust
- Test and finalize ISA simulator
- Write a section on ISA simulator

## Week 3
- Study pipelining for RISC-V
- Begin implementing 5-stage pipeline
- Write a section about pipelined vs single-cycle processor

## Week 4
- Continue implementing 5-stage pipeline
- Test and finalize pipeline
- Write a section about current state of the processor
- Setup experiments with this processor as the base case

## Week 5
- Create presentation of project
- Submit project plan
- Study data hazard detection
- Begin implementing hazard detection unit
- Write a section about hazards in pipelining

## Week 6
- Continue implementing hazard detection unit
- Test and finalize hazard detection unit
- Write a section about current state of the processor with hazard detection
- Compare an discuss results to the base case processor

## Week 7
- Study data forwarding detection
- Begin implementing forwarding detection unit
- Write a section about data forwarding in pipelining

## Week 8
- Continue implementing data forwarding unit
- Test and finalize data forwarding unit
- Write a section about current state of the processor with hazard detection and data forwarding
- Compare an discuss results to the base case processor and the hazard detection processor

## Week 9
- Finalize simulator engine
- Refactor and clean up code
- Convert simulator engine to library create
- Write a section on the final version of the processor

## Week 10
- Setup a Yew project
- Create design and layout for web page

## Week 14
- Write remaining theory and implementation
- Write an abstract for report
- Write an introduction to the project
- Write a conclusion for the project
- Proofread report

## Week 15
- Operating System exam
- Final proofread of report 
- Finish report and submit project

## Extensions
If there is time left over, there are ideas for extensions in the MoSCoW model.
